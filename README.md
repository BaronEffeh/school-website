## How to Use

1. **Admissions Page:** 
   - Shows the admission process with steps and requirements. 
   - Users can also view information about transferring to the school from another institution.

2. **Gallery Page:** 
   - Users can browse school event images by categories. 
   - Clicking on an image opens it in a modal with a "Next" and "Previous" button to navigate through images.

3. **About Page:** 
   - Provides detailed information about the school’s history, academics, extracurricular activities, and community engagement.

4. **Blog Page:** 
   - Displays recent posts and articles related to school news and updates. Each blog post can be clicked for further reading.

5. **Contact Page:** 
   - Provides contact information, including address, phone number, and email. A form allows users to send inquiries directly from the website.

## Customization

To customize the website for a specific school:

1. Replace images in the `src/assets` directory with your own.
2. Modify the content inside the individual page components (e.g., `AboutPage.jsx`, `AdmissionsPage.jsx`, `Gallery.jsx`) to reflect the school's unique information.
3. Update metadata in `Helmet` tags in each page to improve SEO (e.g., school name, descriptions, keywords).

## Deployment

To deploy the website, you can use services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). First, build the project by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build of the website in the `dist` folder. You can then upload this folder to any web hosting service.
